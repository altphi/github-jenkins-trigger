# github-jenkins-trigger

this clojure project listens on *:3838 for json posts from github webhooks, parses out the repository and branch name, and then runs a system call to the jenkins-cli to fire up the build with the following naming convention:

repo-branch
if branch is f/newfeat then
repo-f-newfeat

# build
lein uberjar

# run
java -jar github-jenkins-trigger-0.1.0-standalone.jar http://JENKINS_URL:PORT/
